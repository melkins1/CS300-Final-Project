1. I did everything in the project
2. I did not have a partner
3. Object-oriented programming is very useful for tackling all sorts of problems and c++ is a great language to do it in (Java is still my preference but neither is strictly better than the other)
4. I would give a wider selection of project options for the final project (I know we were allowed to make our own project but I am not great with ideas)
